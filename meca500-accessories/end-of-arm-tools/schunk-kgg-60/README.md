```

### Large Object Handling Sequence

```robotics
// Sequence optimized for larger objects (utilizing 20mm stroke)

```

### Web Interface Testing

Use the Meca500 web interface for initial testing:
1. Navigate to the I/O section
2. Execute `GripperOpen` command and observe full 20mm opening
3. Execute `GripperClose` command and verify complete closure
4. Test with objects of varying sizes within stroke range
5. Verify force application and holding capability

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Gripper not achieving full stroke**
   - Check air pressure (should be up to 8 bar for full performance)
   - Verify pneumatic connections to OPEN (A) and CLOSE (B) ports
   - Inspect for obstructions in gripper mechanism
   - Check M3 threaded barb fittings on gripper

2. **Insufficient gripping force**
   - Verify air pressure settings (maximum 8 bar)
   - Check for pneumatic leaks at all connections
   - Ensure proper gripper finger alignment
   - Verify M5 and M3 threaded barb fitting installation

3. **Slow response time**
   - Check pneumatic cable diameter and length
   - Verify adequate air flow capacity
   - Inspect for restrictions in pneumatic lines
   - Consider shorter cable runs if possible

4. **Positioning errors with larger objects**
   - Recalibrate robot tool center point (TCP) for 20mm stroke
   - Account for gripper stroke in motion planning
   - Verify custom finger geometry and alignment
   - Check for mechanical play in mounting system

5. **Gripper not releasing objects**
   - Verify MPM500 control signals
   - Check opening force capability (53 N)
   - Inspect for object jamming in gripper fingers
   - Ensure adequate opening delay timing

- Verify cycle time performance
- Document any changes in gripper performance

## Performance Optimization

### Stroke Utilization
- Design custom fingers to maximize effective stroke usage
