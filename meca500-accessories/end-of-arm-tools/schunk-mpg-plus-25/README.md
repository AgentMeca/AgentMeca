   - Check M5 threaded barb fittings

2. **Insufficient gripping force**
   - Check air pressure settings (maximum 8 bar)
   - Verify gripper jaw alignment
   - Inspect for pneumatic leaks at connections
   - Ensure proper cable routing

3. **Positioning errors**
   - Recalibrate robot tool center point (TCP)
   - Verify bracket mounting alignment with M3x0.5 screws
   - Check for mechanical play in M4x0.7 mounting screws
   - Validate 90-degree gripper orientation

4. **Excessive noise**
   - Install optional pneumatic muffler
   - Check for air leaks causing whistling
   - Verify proper exhaust port configuration
   - Consider air pressure reduction if suitable

5. **Slow response time**
   - Check pneumatic cable diameter and length
   - Verify adequate air pressure
   - Inspect for restrictions in pneumatic lines
   - Ensure proper MPM500 configuration

## Maintenance
