## Sample Code

### Basic Vacuum Operations

```robotics
// Initialize vacuum system (gripper open = no vacuum)
GripperOpen

// Move to approach position above object
MovePose(200.0, 0.0, 150.0, 0, 180, 0)

// Move down to object surface
MoveLin(200.0, 0.0, 100.0, 0, 180, 0)

// Activate vacuum (gripper close = vacuum on)
GripperClose
Delay(0.5)  // Allow time for vacuum to stabilize

// Lift object
MoveLin(200.0, 0.0, 150.0, 0, 180, 0)

// Move to place position
MovePose(300.0, 100.0, 150.0, 0, 180, 0)

// Lower to place position
MoveLin(300.0, 100.0, 105.0, 0, 180, 0)

// Release vacuum (gripper open = vacuum off)
GripperOpen
Delay(0.5)  // Allow time for release

// Retract
MoveLin(300.0, 100.0, 150.0, 0, 180, 0)
```

### Pick-and-Place with Vacuum Verification

```robotics
// Vacuum pick sequence with verification
MovePose(200.0, 0.0, 150.0, 0, 180, 0)
MoveLin(200.0, 0.0, 100.0, 0, 180, 0)

// Activate vacuum
GripperClose
Delay(1.0)  // Extended delay for vacuum buildup

// Test lift (small movement to verify grip)
MoveLin(200.0, 0.0, 105.0, 0, 180, 0)
Delay(0.5)

// Full lift if grip is secure
MoveLin(200.0, 0.0, 150.0, 0, 180, 0)

// Transport and place
MovePose(300.0, 100.0, 150.0, 0, 180, 0)
MoveLin(300.0, 100.0, 105.0, 0, 180, 0)

// Gentle release
GripperOpen
Delay(0.5)
MoveLin(300.0, 100.0, 150.0, 0, 180, 0)
```

### Web Interface Testing

Use the Meca500 web interface for initial testing:
1. Navigate to the I/O section
2. Execute `GripperClose` command to activate vacuum
3. Execute `GripperOpen` command to deactivate vacuum
4. Verify vacuum response and timing

## Suction Cup Selection

### Factors to Consider
- **Object Material**: Smooth, non-porous surfaces work best
- **Object Size**: Cup diameter should be appropriate for object size
- **Object Weight**: Ensure adequate vacuum force for lifting
- **Surface Conditions**: Clean, flat surfaces provide best seal

### Common Suction Cup Types
- **Flat Cups**: General purpose, smooth flat objects
- **Bellows Cups**: Uneven surfaces, compensation for height variations
- **Deep Cups**: Heavy objects, maximum holding force
- **Specialized Cups**: Specific applications (textured, curved surfaces)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Insufficient Vacuum**
   - Check compressed air pressure (should be 80 psi)
   - Verify all pneumatic connections for leaks
   - Ensure suction cup is appropriate for object surface
   - Check venturi pump ports P+ and P- connections

2. **Vacuum Not Releasing**
   - Verify MPM500 control signals
   - Check for blockages in pneumatic lines
   - Ensure proper GripperOpen command execution
   - Test with different delay times

3. **Object Dropping During Transport**
   - Increase vacuum stabilization delay
   - Check suction cup seal quality
   - Verify object surface cleanliness
   - Consider different suction cup design

4. **System Not Responding**
   - Verify firmware version (8.1.6 or above required)
   - Check MPM500 configuration and connections
   - Test web interface commands manually
   - Verify compressed air supply

## Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
- Inspect pneumatic connections for leaks
- Clean suction cup surfaces regularly
- Check compressed air filter and water trap
- Verify venturi pump for debris or blockage
- Test vacuum performance periodically

### Replacement Parts
- Suction cups (application dependent)
- Pneumatic fittings (M5 threaded or push-to-connect)
- Pneumatic cables (1/16" ID or 4mm OD)
- Venturi pump (if damaged or worn)

## Performance Optimization

### Cycle Time Optimization
- Minimize vacuum buildup delay through testing
- Use appropriate suction cup size for objects
- Optimize approach and retract distances
- Consider parallel vacuum activation during approach

### Reliability Improvements
- Implement vacuum verification routines
- Use redundant vacuum cups for critical applications
- Monitor system pressure regularly
- Establish preventive maintenance schedule
