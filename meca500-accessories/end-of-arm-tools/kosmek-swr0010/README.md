### Automated Tool Change Macro

```robotics
// Define tool change procedure as reusable sequence
// Parameters: current_tool_pos, new_tool_pos

// Step 1: Return current tool (if any)
IF current_tool_attached THEN
    MovePose(current_tool_storage_x, current_tool_storage_y, 150.0, 0, 180, 0)
    MoveLin(current_tool_storage_x, current_tool_storage_y, 108.0, 0, 180, 0)
    GripperOpen
    Delay(0.5)
    MoveLin(current_tool_storage_x, current_tool_storage_y, 150.0, 0, 180, 0)
ENDIF

// Step 2: Acquire new tool
MovePose(new_tool_storage_x, new_tool_storage_y, 150.0, 0, 180, 0)
MoveLin(new_tool_storage_x, new_tool_storage_y, 108.0, 0, 180, 0)
GripperClose
Delay(1)
MoveLin(new_tool_storage_x, new_tool_storage_y, 150.0, 0, 180, 0)

// Step 3: Update tool status
current_tool_attached = TRUE
current_tool_id = new_tool_id
```

### Web Interface Testing

Use the Meca500 web interface for initial testing:
1. Navigate to the I/O section
2. Execute `GripperClose` command to engage tool changer (hold)
3. Execute `GripperOpen` command to disengage tool changer (release)
4. Verify proper coupling engagement and release
5. Test with actual tools to verify repeatability

## Tool Storage Design

### Storage Station Requirements
- **Precision Positioning**: Tool storage must maintain 5-micron repeatability
- **Stable Support**: Tools must be securely supported when not attached
- **Clear Access**: Robot must have unobstructed access to each tool
- **Safety**: Tools must be safely secured when not in use

### Storage Station Layout
```
Tool Station Layout Example:

Position 1: [Tool A] - (200.0, 0.0, 108.0)
Position 2: [Tool B] - (150.0, 200.0, 108.0)
Position 3: [Tool C] - (100.0, 100.0, 108.0)
Home Position: (0.0, 0.0, 200.0)
```
